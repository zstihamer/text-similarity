# Text Similarity scripts

## Cosine Similarity
Text Similarity has to determine how the two text documents close to each other in terms of their context or meaning. There are various text similarity metric exist such as Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance and Jaccard Similarity. All these metrics have their own specification to measure the similarity between two queries.

**_The Cosine similarity of two documents will range from 0 to 1. If the Cosine similarity score is 1, it means two vectors have the same orientation. The value closer to 0 indicates that the two documents have less similarity_**

## Levenshtein distance
The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
